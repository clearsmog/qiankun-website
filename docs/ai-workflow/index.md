Welcome to the AI Workflow section. This area explores how to build, optimize, and deploy robust AI applications, moving beyond simple prompts to complex, reliable systems.

## What is an AI Workflow?

An AI workflow is the orchestrated sequence of steps that an application takes to produce a result using Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI components. Unlike a simple chatbot interaction, a workflow might involve:

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Fetching relevant data before asking the model.
- **Multi-step Chains:** Using the output of one model call as the input for the next.
- **Routing:** Deciding which path to take based on the user's input.
- **Verification:** Checking the model's output for accuracy or safety.

## Why Structure Matters

LLMs are probabilistic. By structuring them into workflows, we can:
1.  **Increase Reliability:** Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
2.  **Improve Accuracy:** Provide specific context and tools for each step.
3.  **Enable Complex Behaviors:** Allow systems to plan, reason, and act.
